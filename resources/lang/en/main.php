Here at For9a we check every opportunity that we post very thoroughly, so the opportunities on our website are geniune. However if you come across other opportunities here are some tips on how to avoid being caught out.',
     '1._Check' =>'1. Check the website links - check the links provided to communicate with opportunities (emails, Facebook, the website URL found in an email or letter). Do these links look genuine? Is it consistent from the university or business name mentioned? Is it from a .com or academic website (.edu is typically used in the US and .ac.uk in the UK)? Does it have a trustworthy web address? Additionally, do an online search for the opportunity or university, it should be clear which is the ‘real’ one. If the web link on the post is different, then it is probably a scam.',
     '2._Also' =>' 2. Also check the Facebook Pages and other social media pages in the same way. Are there different names used?',
     '3._Look' =>' 3. Look t the offer letter - do they give further details (address, bank account information, etc.)? If so, then check these too. If you apply for a university in the UK, the bank details to pay fees should not be located in another country outside of the UK. Always make sure that the recipient is the university itself! If not, be aware that it is a scam!',
     '4._Contact' =>'4. Contact the real provider - contact the people on the real Facebook page or website and forward them the email or posting you received or saw. It might be important for them to be aware of this fake email/scam, and it is a good way to connect to them and learn about the real programmes they offer.',

Here at For9a we check every opportunity that we post very thoroughly, so the opportunities on our website are geniune. However if you come across other opportunities here are some tips on how to avoid being caught out.',
       '1._Check' =>'1. Check the website links - check the links provided to communicate with opportunities (emails, Facebook, the website URL found in an email or letter). Do these links look genuine? Is it consistent from the university or business name mentioned? Is it from a .com or academic website (.edu is typically used in the US and .ac.uk in the UK)? Does it have a trustworthy web address? Additionally, do an online search for the opportunity or university, it should be clear which is the ‘real’ one. If the web link on the post is different, then it is probably a scam.',
       '2._Also' =>' 2. Also check the Facebook Pages and other social media pages in the same way. Are there different names used?',
       '3._Look' =>' 3. Look t the offer letter - do they give further details (address, bank account information, etc.)? If so, then check these too. If you apply for a university in the UK, the bank details to pay fees should not be located in another country outside of the UK. Always make sure that the recipient is the university itself! If not, be aware that it is a scam!',
       '4._Contact' =>'4. Contact the real provider - contact the people on the real Facebook page or website and forward them the email or posting you received or saw. It might be important for them to be aware of this fake email/scam, and it is a good way to connect to them and learn about the real programmes they offer.',
